            <h3>I like you a lot. You know that, right?
                <br>I can’t pretend to know how you feel, but I do know how strong you are.
                <br>You don’t have to handle everything yourself.
                <br>Lean on me and let me help.
                <br>I know you could get through this on your own, but please let me help lighten your load.
                <br>I feel sorry for anyone who underestimates your strength and abilities.
                <br>You’ll make it through this and come out even stronger on the other side.
                <br>Together, we can accomplish anything and overcome any challenge.
                <br>No matter what the future holds, I always want to be with you.
                <br>I've done a lot of experiments to find someone to be with.
                <br>And here I am with you. Don't wanna do experiments anymore.
                <br>This time I've reached the ground state.
                <br>Don't want to lose the stability.
                <br>Zen in zen forever.
                <br>❤
